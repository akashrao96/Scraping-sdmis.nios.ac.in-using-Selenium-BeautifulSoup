The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) was set up as the National Open School in 1989 by
the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, as an autonomous organisation.
It provides educational opportunities to persons who wish to study further and qualify for a better
tomorrow. The Mission of NIOS is to provide education to all with special concern for girls and
women, rural youth, working men and women, SCs and STs, differently abled persons and other
disadvantaged persons who because of one or other reason could not continue their education in the
formal system of education. The aim of NIOS is to reach the unreached.
